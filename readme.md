# TabTransformer-tinygrad

Reimplementation of the [TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling Using Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06678) in `tinygrad`.

I recreated the results for the `insurance_co` dataset. This means I trained a regular MLP and then the TabTransformer to compare their results.
